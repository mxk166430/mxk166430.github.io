Customer Service Issue,@united Blackmailed me into paying Â£130 extra or having my return ticket nullified in San Francisco Airport. Terrible service from rep #scam
Customer Service Issue,@united disappointed that u didnt honor my $100 credit given to me for ur mistakes. Taking my business elsewhere  âœŒï¸out.

Customer Service Issue,@united ok it's now been 7 months waiting to hear from airline. I gave them quite a bit more than the 30 days requested! Terrible service
Customer Service Issue,@united does this process ever end? Still waiting for the reply since 2 months #pathetic #customerservice
Flight Booking Problems,@united What's going on with your website? I'm Flight Booking Problems three tickets today and I've been booted off the system umpteen times.

Lost Luggage,"@united I received 1 bag last night, I am still missing the other one."
Bad Flight,"@united @simonroesner you'll need to upgrade the seats too, even in economy plus it's like sitting on a concrete bench."
Late Flight,@united 2nd flight also delayed no pilots! But they boarded is so we can just sit here! #scheduling
Bad Flight,@united but it's hard to stay upset at someone when they at least TRY to show remorse.
Customer Service Issue,"@united By the way, a simple apology goes a long way, even if it's a hollow one. It's obvious that you don't care about me or my well-being,"
Customer Service Issue,@united This isn't a one time thing either! It's a shocking pattern of repeated neglect and disrespect.
Can't Tell,@united Fingers crossed &amp; its all intact. Very disappointed with this experience as before this we were actually saying we enjoyed using you
Customer Service Issue,"@united It's an incredibly easy fix, but you would rather stay in your comfort zone, while I get forced out of mine."
Flight Attendant Complaints,@united ours in July. You have ZERO excuses for this. You have an out-of-date system that causes problems like this.
Can't Tell,@united Everyone around us is sitting with their friends and family members. They booked their tickets in October and December. We bought
Customer Service Issue,@united Not sure what you are talking about. She is going on nonstop flights. SNA to SFO and then SFO to EWR.
Customer Service Issue,".@united it will be because I'm moving to @AmericanAir because of @united talk, no service"
Customer Service Issue,"@united I asked a legitimate question about systemwide vs. localized problems, and got back an unreLate Flightd copy/paste. You can do better."
Lost Luggage,@united what time? Who can I call. I need my skis. I will go to the airport and get them. No more faith in United.
Can't Tell,@united I see you guys are at it again. Amazing how one company continually makes mistakes yet fails to be held accountable for their error
Late Flight,@united Yeah sorry but there's always a problem with United. And you have an international reputation for having problems.
Can't Tell,"@united but then again, maybe the @BBBNE_SD_KS_IA would care more to hear what went on than whoever listens to issues you caused"
Can't Tell,@united I wonder if sharing all this on FB and insta would produce a number. 140 characters really limits my story telling.
Flight Attendant Complaints,@united so you're telling me there is no number to call after being left in an airport because of a negligent pilot and staff?
Customer Service Issue,@united Could this email be resent as it doesnt appear to have arrived.
Customer Service Issue,@united you have to follow me in order for me to DM...come on now
Bad Flight,"@united $25 United coupon to make up for broken entertainment system on a 9-hour flight, seriously? #Ridiculousness #learncustomerservice"
Lost Luggage,@united So they didn't drop my bag overnight &amp; now I'm leaving for a week. This is why you were supposed to hold on to the bag....

Flight Attendant Complaints,@united are the ones who make it difficult for me.
Bad Flight,@united I'm not a child. I'm someone who has an issue with flying and prepares ahead of time to reduce the distress caused by planes. You

Can't Tell,@united maybe one day you'll be the one quoted on http://t.co/mJkpgVXmPC
Late Flight,@United flight delayed-no one remembered to turn the heat on flight 559 leaving ORD-seriously???
Lost Luggage,@united did  bags make it on the flight out of iad? second day without clothes is pretty inconvenient. We're pretty curious #UnitedAirlines
Lost Luggage,@united did our bags leave Washington yet? That would be convenient seeing as we left there a day ago. #UnitedAirlines #lostluggage
Lost Luggage,@united about 3 hours ago. I need to work out if my bag can make it to my hotel here in time or if it will need to go elsewhere.
Lost Luggage,@united Thanks for remembering to load my bag onto my connecting flight. Oh wait you forgot. Iceland should be fun with no clothes....
Late Flight,@united it was UA flight 1001! Now I'm currently stuck in Portland because I missed my ride because of the 3 hour delay. #GetMartyHome
Lost Luggage,@united how we looking on getting those bags to Lusaka
Lost Luggage,@united Could you update me on the suitcase please? The online and phone tracking told me nothing. I was told I'd have it back yesterday!
Can't Tell,@united just 1 last thing. U guys shouldn't be charging $ for drinks on a transatlantic flight
Can't Tell,@united LHR arrival lounge #fail. Waited 20 mins for shower then left to find hotel. U know how many passengers u carry. Planning???
Cancelled Flight,@united completed form but doubt it's any use. UA doesn't care. 6 day vacation will now be 5. Sure UA won't feel responsibility for that...
Flight Attendant Complaints,"@united nope, they told us it was time for them to go home and to sleep at the airport. Even though they assured us we would get a room..."
Lost Luggage,"@united ..back for the expensive holiday, he worked all year to pay for, that you RUINED! We want compensation &amp; his original case back!"
Lost Luggage,@united thanks United I understand that. But he would actually like his own bag back! What have you done with it?! He also wants the money..
Late Flight,"@united It's still a valid flight. Just seems strange to delay for Late Flight inbound crew,  7 hours from now, when the plane is already here."
Bad Flight,@united   It's too bad UA has had another unforeseeable operational issue on my return flight.
Lost Luggage,@united if I pay you $25 and $35 for my luggage to be delivered when I arrive. Why should I have to wait 3 additional days for its delivery?
Cancelled Flight,@united so 8 hotels for 32 people but feel like we are being held hostage because someone has our boarding passes so we can't leave! #FAIL
Late Flight,@united no Cancelled Flightn just left us to fend for ourselves when flt came in Late Flight. Getting runaround for 3 hrs. Each employee blaming  previous 1.
Lost Luggage,@united okay ase24766m. Find our luggage.
Lost Luggage,@united But they are not... lady one phone says its in tel aviv. Tel Aviv united says its in Newark. No one knows and I have nothing...
Lost Luggage,"@united yes, but still now answers. Many have not had their luggage for 3 days! Unacceptable!!"
Can't Tell,@united plus what about food? And taxis?
Can't Tell,@united you are offering us 8 rooms for 32 people #FAIL
Flight Attendant Complaints,@united 32 people getting pretty tired about no action on solving the problem plus missing a day of vacation and skiing
Late Flight,@united on 4124 arriving two hours Late Flight into CLT. Now sitting on the tarmac while they move a plane from the gate. Unhappy customer.
Can't Tell,@united airlines is the absolute worst. They have no idea what they are doing. #neveragain #UnitedAirlines
Flight Booking Problems,"@united it's frustrating, as a frequent flyer, loyal since Continental. Upgrade equals paying 3 times or more on top of purchase ticket."
Late Flight,@united 4 passengers after a 2 hour delayed flight left with no hotel at the end of the night @ hou airport. Wtf??!! http://t.co/ZfqMpGXVS6
Late Flight,"Hey @united why does the flight from IAH to POS leave so Late Flight, and the one back to IAH so early? I rather get to POS earlier"
Lost Luggage,@united Lost bag process is broken. Agent promised they'd call &amp; hold my bag when found. Now they're waking me at 3am w/ delivery. #fail
Cancelled Flight,@united the people at the counter have been very helpful. As you can see nobody is there. Flight to Austin 10:55 and still sitting here.
Late Flight,"@united good to know you will open the closed doors for ""premier passengers"" after safety briefings on delayed flights. #annoyed."
Late Flight,@united yea get me to phoenix already. Delays all day with you people. It's bullshit.
Late Flight,"@united If it's any consolation, your staff was stellar. Just not the hour+ delays I encountered with every one of my 4 flights."
Cancelled Flight,@united Lost bags. Cancelled Flightled flights. Delhi call centers. Poor United staff spread thin and stressed. You name it.
Lost Luggage,@united Yes. Doesn't make that mistake any less absurd. Doesn't change the fact that I'm very inconveniently missing my luggage tonight.
Can't Tell,@united I'm constantly having challenges with upgrades &amp; charges. In order to prevent DVT I have to pay an addtl $180 http://t.co/xC6jQ70r7B
Flight Attendant Complaints,"@united In ORD, waited 20 min after crew members left before gate items came. Flight attendant sarcastically said good luck and walked away."
Can't Tell,@united seriously #fail on making strangers share a room
Lost Luggage,@united we needed them here asap. Will they make it on today's flight?
Flight Attendant Complaints,@united why would they make me share a room?
Late Flight,@united can you ask your guys with flight 1146 to BWI to wait for us to get off a delayed flight from San Diego? Pretty please?
Cancelled Flight,"@united for an early flt, I think a call is appropriate. Yes, reviewed and nada avail until next day. Expect full refund"
Late Flight,@united Yo yo yo stuck on the tarmac for over 2 hours at @fly2ohare ... Going to miss my ride at @flypdx help please! #HelpImStuck #United
Flight Attendant Complaints,"@united well, considering every agent before claimed they were unable to help with everything else, why waste more time to hear 'call corp'"
Cancelled Flight,"@united Ice, which I totally understand. But when a large number of us are facing 15+ hours of time and overnight Cancelled Flightations it seems like"
Cancelled Flight,@united flt 1249 Cancelled Flightled and I get email @3:30 AM? What happened to courtesy phn call? Had to book diff airline &amp; city
Lost Luggage,"@united tag numbers 0016 964012, 0016 964077, 0016 964078 - let's find these bags."
Can't Tell,@united Well the bar is set low! You guys are really good at the apology game! What will change? When will u guys learn?
Can't Tell,@united Your website deserves a new design. #html5 FTW!
Lost Luggage,@united thanks for effing up our holidays - we're missing a full day of skiing due to your baggage team's incompetence at @FlyYOW
Lost Luggage,@united Connection at ORD was on the exact same plane again. Checked carry-on was apparently taken off &amp; left in Chicago. Pretty ridiculous.
Lost Luggage,@united Not encouraged that I'll have my CPAP tonight.
Lost Luggage,@united Yes. Did file a claim as soon as the carousel stopped without my bag on it. Got an email that its found but not sched for delivery
Late Flight,@united  Delay DEN-CLE because they have to manually enter baggage tags? Really? Worst cust service day for this 1ker. #friendlyskies??
Flight Attendant Complaints,"@united Why tell us flight is delayed, then tell us it's on time again with 20 min to spare? Don't say it's delayed unless you're sure!"
Lost Luggage,"@united yes in Lusaka, Zambia. My guess is the bags never made the plane at IAD."
Late Flight,"@united Late Flight to Denver, Late Flight to Newark...let's not even get into the disaster that was checking bags. Unacceptable."
Can't Tell,@united has once again let me down. Don't think I've ever flown with them and not had problems. Worst airline period.
Lost Luggage,@united yes I filed a claim &amp; hope to receive by luggage by 2am. Ridiculous as I had to purchase items to go to sleep &amp; no reimbursement.
Bad Flight,@united UA938 ORD-LHR.  bags are being loaded 30min Late Flight. Frigid air into cabin! Plane feels like falling apart! Upgrade long haul fleet!
Flight Attendant Complaints,"@united Flight attendant never served me my beverage (tea), and not once checked up on me. What gives? #ua6076 #notcool"
Can't Tell,@united load balancing system apparently down #systemwide - major impact on all #united airlines flights. Was this a #cyberattack?
Late Flight,@united After our unscheduled refueling stop and missing 2 connecting flights we r home n looking 4ward to our bed and a big PB&amp;J sandwich.
Can't Tell,@united @AmericanAir spent hundreds to rectify the situation and you guys go quiet
Late Flight,@united UA276 sitting at EWR nearly an hour after sked.  Pilot says computers down but no clue when we will leave.  Can you help?
Can't Tell,@united @AmericanAir so that's it? It just ends there? Come on! I traveled for literally an extra day and a half because of this!
Bad Flight,@united updated A320 aircraft has wifi and device entertainment but no outlets. I don't get it. How can I charge devices?
Late Flight,"@united 5 gate changes, two delays.  Even the crew thinks the airline sucks"
Cancelled Flight,@united I'm very frustrated and have wasted 2 days now due to your equipment failures.
Flight Booking Problems,@united That's correctâ€”I've spent hours trying to book online only to receive an error when clicking final purchase button. (1/2)
Late Flight,@united Today was not your finest. All could have been prevented by one gate agent advising 200 passengers.
Late Flight,@united  what is the real deal with the delay on flight UA 1032 from Denver to Vegas?
Flight Attendant Complaints,@united UA63 from Madrid arrived no agent mass confusion we sent to and fro by 3 UA employees. MaryJo was rude and unhelpful.
Bad Flight,@united system failure again = bad trend.  Software projects are like flying an airplane; there's no such thing as an emergency takeoff.
Late Flight,@united lots of reports of system failures delaying flights over the last week. Currently sitting on the tarmac at OGG for over an hour.
Lost Luggage,@united can you tell me how to file a claim for clothing that had to be purchased?
Can't Tell,@united comically on the return flight from ASE there were two United flights boarding at adjacent gates and not clear which plane to board
Lost Luggage,@united GRK13575M is the file reference
Bad Flight,"@united UA 746. Pacific Rim and Date Night cut out. Not constantly or randomly, but one spot, repeatably."
Can't Tell,@united Been trying since 1230 to file a report.
Flight Booking Problems,@united here is the ticket # 0162424965446 please refund my unnecessary upgrade fee
Bad Flight,"@united is horrible!! They lost our carseat and expect us to use a loner carseat, safety regulations say it's illegal to use a used car seat"
Flight Booking Problems,"@united: I don't care that a @thehipmunk link showed me a ""wrong"" price on your siteâ€”it's your site &amp; responsibility to ensure correctness."
Cancelled Flight,"@united He needs to get to home the 24th, they're telling him it'll be the 25th @ night. Is there compensation or anything that can be done?"
Can't Tell,â€œ@united: @mllovelace The baggage fee is waived for Premier members. Please see http://t.co/u6Duw27mDE. ^JPâ€ what's the point of membership?
Lost Luggage,@united wonderful bag claim people - finally have my bag. But why did I catch earlier flight? Original flight just landed. #wastedtime
Can't Tell,@united Dmed you. Thank you
Lost Luggage,"@united 3 days Late Flightr and my bag has not left IAD, United is not helping at all. Everyone tells me a different story"
Lost Luggage,@United how do you lose a gate checked bag DEN to ORD? Direct flight. Ugh.
Lost Luggage,"@united caught earlier flight to ORD. Gate checked bag, and you've lost it at O'Hare. original flight lands in 20minutes. #frustrating!"
Lost Luggage,@united Can you please follow for a Dm on a missing bag?
Lost Luggage,@united what's a good number to call to speak with someone about how you can fix what you did to 50 people and their luggage on Saturday?
Lost Luggage,@united where's my damn bag??

Cancelled Flight,@united FAIL You Cancelled Flightled our flight frm GJT and then used our reserv home to IAH (from SEA) for reFlight Booking Problems w/out OUR PERMISSION!! #PH6RPS
Late Flight,@united has made my no fly list. Other airlines wait when connector Late Flight. Stuck in IAH.
Bad Flight,@United now what?!? http://t.co/5hpSqVRjK8 flight was gone when I got off plane! #BusinessTravel #goodenoughmother
Lost Luggage,"@united the proper response: sorry for your wait, what flight # were you on so we can look into the issue. That's how @Delta would handle."
Flight Attendant Complaints,@united Agent in LAS letting 20 customers know they can't help them rebook delayed flight to DEN #unfriendlyskies http://t.co/QuzVmK2rTR
Bad Flight,@united empathizes w/ my disappointment that 1stClass flight w/nonworking entertainmnt is worth $50. #UnFriendlySkies http://t.co/lOecO4gmvd
Flight Booking Problems,@united searched for mileage tickets to BOM couldn't find a single one is saver awards - I see how you play.  Earn miles but can't use them.
Lost Luggage,"@united flight arrives 30 minutes early, but then have we to wait for an hour for our bags."
Lost Luggage,@united That's not the issue. The fact that no one even called (despite promises) to confirm the bag's location is.
Can't Tell,@united still waiting to hear back. My wallet was stolen from one of your planes so would appreciate a resolution here
Lost Luggage,@united or @flysaa has lost my baggageâ€¦ heard different things from different employees of @united. @flysaa has said nothing.
Bad Flight,"@united cs thinks that miles can repair the damage done, it will be interesting if they travel in @united and exp the worst flight ever!"

Cancelled Flight,@united Exhausted &amp; frustrated! Link to a FB post abt my travel issue https://t.co/LaRKC8vc4s
Flight Attendant Complaints,@united I was denied getting on the plane w/o getting the chance to prove it fits. I'm not a rookie. Read my bio.
Flight Attendant Complaints,@united currently on board so not now. Check in was terrible. Staff rude. Expensive luggage thrown around etc.
Cancelled Flight,"@United fucked up, then voided my ticket, and KEPT MY MONEY.  Not even an apology. I will never fly with your airline again. #UnitedAirlines"
Can't Tell,"@united Just got demoted from Gold cuz my hubby got 100% of the PQD, tho there were enuf $ spent for 4 Golds.#spousal.discrimination/angry."

Can't Tell,@united first time flying with United. Also last time. #terrible back to @VirginAtlantic for me. #branson #virginatlantic #UnitedAirlines
Can't Tell,@united I used to be a committed #ContinentalAirlines flyer until merger. I remember now why I switched to @SouthwestAir #CommunicationFail
Bad Flight,@united the least you could do is offer me a ticket in coach instead of just Cancelled Flighting my reservation because of your glitch!!! #notfair
longlines,"@united I'm saying I made the flight but with poor/non-communication, unaccounted for lost time &amp; lots of frustrated flyers standing around"
Can't Tell,@united I think DM would be better
Late Flight,@United gate announcement states delay due to maintenance yet app says Late Flight arriving aircraft  tell the truth! @unfriendly
Lost Luggage,@united you are easily the worst company I have ever experienced. You have lost someone's personal possessions &amp; you couldn't care less!....
Late Flight,@united how can your app show arriving aircraft is early but departing flight is delayed due to Late Flight arriving aircraft? @unfriendly
Lost Luggage,@united already did that at the airport and 12 hrs Late Flightr its still not here! you guys are really killing me today. trying to stay positive..

Late Flight,@united by the time I finally get to Dallas I could have driven with less frustration and cheaper.
Late Flight,"@united I'm trying to get to my final destination, we need compensation. Just about 2hrs of personal time wasted."
Lost Luggage,@united how can you not put my bag on plane to Seattle. Flight 1212. Waiting  in line to talk to someone about my bag. Status should matter.
Can't Tell,"@united @campilley hahaha. If they weren't an American company, i would say this was great sarcasm!!"

Flight Attendant Complaints,@united Apparently they are asking 20 people to off board the plane--how can such a big miscalculation be made?!
Can't Tell,@united It's a shame choosing #United may be the difference between reuniting with aging friends and never seeing them again #PoorService

Can't Tell,@united Can't leave the Tarmac ..united's gate agent cannot agree on a head count. 20 min now counting a 100 people max #epicfailunited
Can't Tell,@united That's real dedication &amp; concern. Your apologies don't fix the issue nor any of the miserable issues I've had over the past 6 mos.
Flight Booking Problems,@united booked flights for 2 for $779. Was charged $389.50 twice. Means I can't redeem CC points properly. Would have gone elsewhere.
Lost Luggage,@united We've had a ton of problems with getting our bags and have been given the run around for a day. Whats up with that?
Flight Booking Problems,@united pedophile airline. Split myself and my 10 yr old daughter rows apart on flight 1254 to boston
Lost Luggage,@united have been waiting 2 days for my military bags from an airport 3 hours away from me. Horrible.
Bad Flight,"@united Arriving 25 minutes early is nice, but not if equipment isn't ready. Waiting 30 minutes for luggage, so far. Time gains wiped out."

Late Flight,"@united really? 3 hr delay, 4 gate changes, &amp; you boarded us, sent us back up, &amp; boarded us again.  Won't change our flight. Can we go now?"
Bad Flight,@united I did. The AC went on for about 20 minutes before returning to the Mojave Desert. #PressureCooker #HeatTrap
Late Flight,@united when an airline causes the missed connection u would think they would take whatever steps to remedy that screw up.
Late Flight,@united Flight UA1270 is descending into farce and we haven't left EWR yet. Is this going to get any worse?
Bad Flight,"@united I was told it was due to be on UA23 which flies direct to Dublin, so why did it go to London? This is a complete shambles!"

Late Flight,@united I wasn't asking for a full refund but delaying me 3 hours and giving no reason should be enough to give partial credit

Flight Booking Problems,@united pushing five hours and my time is worth nothing to you. reFlight Booking Problems not an option unfortunately.
Bad Flight,@united - Plane came in with broken seat.  Rather than fix it they put a broken sign on it and separated me from my kids.
Cancelled Flight,@united have you read your own same day travel change policy?
Bad Flight,"@united your b737-800w  literally the smallest seats I have ever have, my dad got stuck In the tiny bathroom ad well #disspointed #premier1k"
Cancelled Flight,"@united my flight was already Cancelled Flightled this morning because of a ""snow storm in Denver"". And now I'm in DC waiting for a pilot to get on+"
longlines,@united still sucks. I don't understand why you have two cust service agents for a long line at Houston international b gate #unitedsucks
Bad Flight,@united I'd rather spend two days in the back seat of a Volkswagen than two hours on your plane! #disgruntled #whatacluster
Cancelled Flight,@united I have to go back home! I have to use what the company has available. But it's unfair to stay more than 24 h traveling
Bad Flight,@united yes... A ride home would be perfect.. A fete one would assume possible after charging 1600$ for a domestic flight... Ps we deplaned
Bad Flight,@united--excited to barrel through the sky at 600mph on a 75 ton piece of metal operated by a company that can't get their tiny TVs to work!
Flight Booking Problems,"@united heard about the voucher/miles credit for Cancelled Flighting my international flight yesterday, but I didn't get an email."
Bad Flight,"@united, maybe don't play the video about how your flights are outfitted w wifi on the flights where wifi isn't working...âœˆï¸"
Cancelled Flight,@united I believe. It was Cancelled Flighted yesterday I guess. Goes back to no notification from United about Cancelled Flightlation
Bad Flight,"@United is an airline where you pay extra to get a better seat but by the time you board your overbooked flight, there's no overhead space."
Bad Flight,@United Personal Device Entertainment system is great but with app crashing every 10/15 mins I'm glad it's free for now.

Flight Booking Problems,"@united thank you for dishonoring my upgrade and putting me in a seat I didn't want, all while not even notifying me.  Great 1K service ðŸ‘Ž"
Cancelled Flight,@united the emails/calls over the past months about flight changes were helpful wish you would have sent them on the Cancelled Flightlation yesterday
Flight Attendant Complaints,"@united - so they changed depart from 1:45 to 2:00pm &amp; it is now 1:40pm &amp; the Capt. just got off the plane to find a smoothie, 2pm my ass!!!"
Bad Flight,"@united a baby shit its pants half way through my flight and it smelled like shit, what are you going to do about this?"
Flight Attendant Complaints,@united more people would catch their flights if your attendants had more help!
Flight Booking Problems,"@united your website is fucked up. Now instead of a $416 flight I shouldâ€™ve had yesterday, itâ€™s $514 today. Thanks."
Flight Attendant Complaints,"@united I'm not sure how you can help. Your flight experience is terrible, planes are dirty and staff is rude. Start over perhaps?"
Flight Booking Problems,@united I bought a ticket yesterday and received a confirmation. Tried to check in and they said I hadn't paid for it. So I called was on
Flight Attendant Complaints,@united I unfortunately didn't get her name :( she was not nice!
Bad Flight,@united  what did you do with my seat. International connection. Seriously?
Cancelled Flight,@united Then you delete my return ticket to Europe and blame me for the now show? This airline is a joke. 3 times this happened now.3 times!
Flight Attendant Complaints,@united flight 5903 stranded on Tarmac in Chicago. No gates available?! Plane getting very hot and uncomfortable.
Flight Booking Problems,@united Adding reservation to iOS app doesn't show up on desktop site when logged in. And miles can't be redeemed for upgrades thru your app
Cancelled Flight,@united I assume that would be for the other 300 people who have been let down by United? What's worse is plane is here but crew can't fly!!
Flight Attendant Complaints,@united so this did not work out at all!! Incredibly unfriendly ground staff and false promises over Twitter @theairhelper
Cancelled Flight,@united The so below skilled staff and inadequate system just deleted my return from Houston to Norway. Shoulder shrugging is all you do..
Flight Attendant Complaints,@united severely under staffed at Iah.
Bad Flight,"@united broken light, 35 mins to get bridge to gate, airplane parked wrong , bathroom not emptied last night....your airline in last 3 hrs"
Bad Flight,@united I would appreciate a response regarding the pressurization failure on flight 1109. You seem to be responding to less serious issues
Flight Attendant Complaints,@united not for me.  I am on another Ua flight 2 gates down that was held 15 mins for cnx pax.
Flight Attendant Complaints,@united it's boarding time for ua3882 but no crewe
longlines,@united no way one person is working entire security checkpoint in EWR ðŸ†–
Cancelled Flight,@united so? Found anything or just showing off? You do realise that the morning flight that you Cancelled Flightled was more pricey than the evening?
Flight Attendant Complaints,@united employee=faceless. Don't throw them under the bus. Starts with management. I'm almost a million miler and own my own company. 1/2
Cancelled Flight,@united  I understand that but why should I pay to change if it was a problem with your plane. If it was weather I would understand
Cancelled Flight,@united 30 hours Late Flightr still no answers stuck in Houston. Keep getting put on phantom flights that never apeared. #BadCustomerService
Cancelled Flight,"@united the hotel you sent us to wouldnt take the voucher. Our flight was delayed, then Cancelled Flightled, then delayed again. 32 hours and counting"
Cancelled Flight,@united last week we also had maintenance issues and a flat tire. Another flight last week was Cancelled Flighted. Your track record is the WORST!
Cancelled Flight,@united you should spend all of the money you take for our tickets and update your planes! Each flight has a maintenance issue!!!
Cancelled Flight,@united any chance you could help rebook?? My flight Cancelled Flightled
Cancelled Flight,@united you really need a better system for handling Cancelled Flightled flights http://t.co/3uBCoAsyws
Cancelled Flight,@united involuntarily bumped your passenger and can't guarantee them another flight for three days!
Cancelled Flight,"@united I did already rebook, and now I will miss my first appointments in London tomorrow morning. Thanks for ruining my trip - AGAIN!"
Bad Flight,"@united your first class is a joke, compared to all the others I have flown, don't ask for extra peanuts... That's NOT allowed! @AirCanada"
Flight Attendant Complaints,"@united 100% I will put together a very serious email, with all the issues that arose on our vacation due to your staff I will post it here"
longlines,@united the long wait was the icing on the cake. Why don't you fix your reservation system so the confirm # doesn't get changed mid-travel
Bad Flight,@united lost 4 loyal customers and mileage plus card holders. We could have driven to Florida from Pa quicker both ways! Worst trip ever!
longlines,"@united did your super computer ðŸ’© ots pants? Lots of cranky people in line at CMH reFlight Booking Problems, delaying check-ins of on-time, direct flyers"
longlines,"@united, fuck you and your closed premier access lines at ORD. Probably gonna miss my flight...Start treating your customers better."
Bad Flight,@united Good luck with the no-enertainment-on-6-hour-flights strategy. Innovation at work. Hello @jetblue http://t.co/HI76BOavXY
Bad Flight,@united you would think you would clean your ramps. Our jet is stuck in the snow in Newark. This would never happen with @Delta
Flight Booking Problems,@united overbooked by FIFTY people?!? the worst.
Bad Flight,@united The engineer that designed the 787 door frame to extend half a foot into the plane for seat 27A should be forced to always sit here
longlines,"@united your service need work - check out this Bush airport ""customer service line"" last nt #unitedagainstunited http://t.co/g00sAozgtv"
Bad Flight,@united wifi wasn't working onboard.Alerted attendant re socket.You sent me to a hotel for 24 hours with 7$ Vouchers??no wifi at hotel
Flight Attendant Complaints,@united no my concerns were not addressed
Flight Attendant Complaints,@united it's disgusting and unconscionable the treatment I've received tonight.
Flight Booking Problems,@united I bought a ticket with a price that was published by mistake and now I got an email that indicates United Cancelled Flightled my ticket! Why?
Flight Attendant Complaints,@united Missing flight attendant = Delayed Flight. Prime example how 1 person impacts 100's of people. HNL -&gt; IAH (UA252) #wastedtime
Flight Booking Problems,"@united screwed up our reservation- they assigned a new # to just one of us &amp; when they changed our flight, only changed the original #."
Flight Booking Problems,@united had a different fiasco on my outward trip and was rebooked on to qantas lax-Syd. No FF miles show up in my account for that :(
Flight Booking Problems,"@united on a 4 seg flt yvr to zurich, why would you credit all miles and but only 2 segs on full fare?"
Flight Attendant Complaints,@united the lounge tells us they have no pillows for my grandma as one of the ladies opens the closet and I see 2 right there. #unitedlies
Flight Attendant Complaints,@united well this one missed the mark.  She was in a snit from the minute I stepped up to the counter
Flight Attendant Complaints,@united who compensates is for the delays caused by the fact that you don't have enough flight attendants?? http://t.co/96apr35qan
longlines,@united boarding a #plane would be much faster if you boarded back to front instead of front to back #MakesSense #efficiency #travel #flying
Flight Attendant Complaints,"@united it's 9:56, and the desk attendant stated we would ""sit awhile"" until given the all clear. Lack of communication seems to the norm."
Flight Attendant Complaints,@united Sandra at ur international checkin counter was rude and offensive.  She commented she didn't care if I complained cuz she had 25yrs
Flight Attendant Complaints,@united My contact stuff is in the bag and I'm legally blind. This is so messed up.
Flight Booking Problems,"@united Yeah, I tried that about 10 times for two different tickets, and it told me to ""Try again Late Flightr""."
Flight Attendant Complaints,@united please fire the captain of flight 6232 today. He single handedly ruined every passengers day by being a piece of shit. #unitedsucks
Flight Attendant Complaints,@united why do you hire POS pilots? Thanks for ruining my trip and not allowing me to see my buddy as he turns 30. #unitedsucksdick
longlines,"@united instead of be told when we board, we have to wait for the emails telling us about the delays."
Flight Attendant Complaints,"@united unfortunately, they didn't. I asked the staff if they could help. they said we should ask ppl in our row to switch, but no one would"
Flight Booking Problems,"@united Well, to the degree that he could... Just to know, after this experience I'm Cancelled Flighting my miles card. Thank god for @Delta"
longlines,@united congratulations united. Fail again. Sky at a gate with a plane full of people waiting on 2. Weather gets worse now we can't leave.
Flight Booking Problems,@united is trying to strand us in Houston until tomorrow morning. pretty sure overFlight Booking Problems and maintenance aren't our fault.
Flight Attendant Complaints,"@united God damn fucking crew won't be here till 6:40, so you've known for over an hour and a half the flight time was bullshit."
Flight Attendant Complaints,@united you really do have a culture problem. Everyone I tried to work with blamed someone else or told me how they're short staffed
longlines,@united Flight Cancelled Flightled to BDL and stranded @Dulles_Airport. Waiting almost 2hrs at customer service. Shout out to diligent agents.
longlines,@united seriously? 2-4 hrs to get bags from IAD intl arvls to carousel 2 for custs w/Cancelled Flightled connects? I understand irrops but ridiculous!
Flight Booking Problems,@united I keep getting kicked to an error message when trying to purchase a flight on http://t.co/p3N2w8JfpS. Have tried at least 4x.
Flight Attendant Complaints,@united employees almost seem happy when delivery terrible customer service.

Flight Attendant Complaints,"@united cabin crew were huge offenders, stood as a conversational cluster blocking exiting passengers"
Flight Attendant Complaints,@united no wheelchairs
Flight Attendant Complaints,"@united has me #stranded (weather NOT to blame). 1hr+ hold to speak to an agent that doesn't understand the concept of time zones, thanks!"
Flight Attendant Complaints,@united have an employee at the gate 15min before boarding like u expect ur customers to. Be a competent company like ur rivals
Flight Attendant Complaints,"@united And then when we asked the stewardess to take the disinfectant wipe as trash she said, ""not with my hands!"" #badservice"
Flight Attendant Complaints,"@united nope. Called, lost the seating preference I paid for, and here I still sit. We'll see what happens w/ my flight Late Flightr."
Flight Attendant Complaints,@united Just let the employees know that good service and a kind attitude towards customers is vital in this kind of business. Thanks
longlines,@united need assistance. Line is out the door and travelling with 3 kids.
Flight Attendant Complaints,@united Friend at O'Hare and can't get on flight bc they say no proof he bought 1st class tkt. He has boarding pass.
longlines,"@United Right now at Tropic Air in San Pedro, #Belize. Line out the door. All due to elected &amp; appointed hacks http://t.co/kKEDjNRTWoâ€"
Flight Booking Problems,"@united Your new mileage policy is awful. Before, I might have paid slightly more for United because of miles. Now there's no difference."
Flight Booking Problems,"@united in the process of purchasing ticket, when prices changed. unbelievable. #RipOffs #PriceDiscrimination"
Flight Attendant Complaints,@united #bullying in the #workforce not ok. Get gate agents 2 work as a team. 2 against 1 is never cool. #Delays #flights #UnitedAirlines
Flight Booking Problems,"@united your website won't allow me to post the required document, i keep getting **were having technical difficulties**"
Flight Booking Problems,@united I am not digging the new mileage earning plan. I would earn about 1/3 of the miles I do now. Any changes to the award ticket prices?
longlines,@united bad idea to let 200 people back on the terminal with food vouchers but allow only 15 minutes to get anything.  Long lines!! #ua1523
Flight Booking Problems,@united what's going on with the mileage plus accounts? Login through username and email have been down for at least three days.
Flight Booking Problems,@United site errored out at last step of changing award. Now can't even pull up reservation. 60 minute wait time.  Thanks @United!
longlines,@united at MSP w/3 employees trying to check in several hundred and the line is crazy might miss our plane be sure to thank these employees
Flight Booking Problems,@united I had planned to book additional flights tonight but after 1 1/2 hrs working on one trip I'm worn out! #EnoughIsEnough
Flight Booking Problems,@united She ðŸ‘ won't ðŸ‘ be ðŸ‘ at ðŸ‘ my ðŸ‘ wedding ðŸ‘. This is an irreplaceable milestone. There's no reFlight Booking Problems. How can we be repaid for this?
Flight Booking Problems,@united Yes there were PLENTY of seats available.  So why did Vicky Thomas refuse to give one to a million mile flyer?
Flight Booking Problems,@united Also your at-gate monitor showed 23 empty seats
Flight Booking Problems,"@united very exasperating I'm having a difficult time with Flight Booking Problems as the error message says you're undergoing maintenance. Really, now?"
longlines,"@united sure, but 8 different texts changing time &amp; gate (especially locations across the entire concourse). That just seemed a little off."
longlines,@united if I wait I'll lose the flight. So frustrating.
longlines,@united You can bump me up to Group 3 so I won't be forced to check my bag and wait 30+ minutes at LGA.
longlines,@united I think you should board from the back of the plane #whatstheholdup #CHItoCLE
longlines,@united not anymore.  Finally was ticketed 5 min before takeoff.  Not sure why the confusion with a full-fare GSA ticket.
longlines,@united don't know if you are aware that ALL of your premier access lines are closed in your terminal. I feel the love.
longlines,@united it's freezing on the gate bridge#waitingforbags#united#EWR
longlines,@united 40+ minutes waiting at the gate for the broken jetway. Different gate maybe?
longlines,@united still sitting here waiting for a plane....4 hours wasted
longlines,"@united line is just getting longer and moving slower. Lady working the counter is doing great, she just needs help. #customerservicefail"
longlines,@united Your boarding process sucks. You should learn from @SouthwestAir
longlines,@united not about being on my way or impatience on my part...it's about you being untruthful and not having proper systems in place
longlines,@united your airline is a joke. 1 person working special services at EWR?!? Line is 15 ppl deep. GROW UP!
longlines,@united 1k use to be special.  80 people in group one.   Why not board global AND 1k together? http://t.co/qd2lyUXAZg
longlines,@united can you get a gate for UA4727?  Turrible.
longlines,"@united I'm checked in, agent wouldn't tag my bags at 7am. Now I'm standing in line hell."
longlines,"@united Thanks for your response. Bags came, but it was a long wait and priority tags weren't honored at all. Disappointing"
longlines,@united last night we waited forever at the gate because someone from corporate dispatch FORGOT to call the crew #unfriendlyskies
longlines,@SouthwestAir still waiting. Just hit one hour.
longlines,@SouthwestAir poor performance all around! Paid for Express checkin weeks ago and can't even leverage it #bullshit
longlines,@SouthwestAir Logically you would think you check all that before you have people board. I could've drove home in the time I've been waiting
longlines,@SouthwestAir flight 1614 FLL to ATL. My wife traveling with infant. Line to check baggage 200 people long due to your computer system crash

longlines,@SouthwestAir the wait for the bags is longer than the actual flight.

longlines,@southwestair Grand total from landing to getting bag: one hour. That's very sad.
longlines,@SouthwestAir there's an hour wait here for reFlight Booking Problems in line at Omaha.

longlines,"@southwestair three flights with three  check in agents, not enough. #missedflight  back to Jet Blue"
longlines,@SouthwestAir why doesn't your terminal B in LGA have pre-check? Makes me want to never fly your airline
longlines,@SouthwestAir Unable to check in my flight. It says my itinerary is ineligible for checkin online. Go to counter. Very inconvenient!!!
longlines,@SouthwestAir please hire an efficiency consultant to manage your PHX baggage checkin. Way to many open kiosks with 100's of ppl waiting
longlines,"@SouthwestAir humor aside, we've been stuck on the plane for two hours at the gate because bags can't be loaded correctly. What gives?"
longlines,"@SouthwestAir Open more kiosks at 
Austin-Bergstrom. Three lanes to service a line of 50 people? Really?"
longlines,@SouthwestAir good to know NOW!  Three sets of travelers in just 20 mins standing here waiting for mins to pass by.
longlines,@SouthwestAir So I guess you can get to the airport too early!  Need to wait 10mins to checkin. Really?
longlines,@SouthwestAir how does your pre boarding process work? Basically anyone who doesn't want to wait their turn can get a slip?
longlines,@SouthwestAir why do your MDW gates have so many fewer seats than your planes?
longlines,"@SouthwestAir Next once we arrived to Atlanta, we waited a full HOUR before our luggage was placed on a carousel. One hour!"
longlines,@SouthwestAir  flight at 630 from fll kiosk just opened. Rude attendants because now everyone is Late Flight. http://t.co/2Boh2Mh3cb

longlines,@SouthwestAir your checkin system is #poor
longlines,"@JetBlue nope. The ""regular"" line was multi-x faster. You literally direct all the wheelchairs and strollers into the same line as EMS."
longlines,@JetBlue oh right! Me and hundred people arrived back to the same gate we left minutes ago in SDQ http://t.co/7gB0hgW51t
